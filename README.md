The goal of the project is to create a contant based movie recommendation system which is a type of artificial intelligence technology that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and behaviours.
<br>
These systems use algorithms to analyze a user's viewing history, ratings, and other data points to recommend movies that they might enjoy. Movie recommendation systems are commonly used by streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video to suggest movies and TV shows to their subscribers.
These systems are designed to provide personalized recommendations to each user, based on their unique tastes and viewing history. The algorithms used in movie recommendation systems can be based on a variety of factors, such as genre, director, cast, and storyline.

Content Filtering Recommendation Systems:
<br>
 A content-based recommendation system is a type of recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations to users based on the features or characteristics of items, such as movies, books, or products, without relying on past user interactions or behaviors. The system recommends items that are similar in content or characteristics to the items that the user has liked or shown interest in.
